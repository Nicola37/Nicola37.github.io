    <div class = "optionHeader VIBESHeader" style="text-align:right;padding-right: 5vw;font-size: 5vmin;">How to Harness Latent Curiosity</div>

    <div class = "optionText VIBESText" style="text-align:left; line-height:2">
      <br>&emsp;&emsp;I recently had the great fortune of contributing to the <a href="https://www.kidzhack.com/vibes" target="_blank" style="color:rgb(235, 130, 55)">VIBES</a> project, which aims to provide personalized assistance to middle school kids (and their adults) to help them grow in emotional maturity and social awareness. Though I worked on many aspects of the project's early stages - including design language, prototype development, and both UX and creative writing - I would like to provide a deep dive into a seemingly innocuous aspect of student-side interaction design I focused on for the VIBES <b>M</b>inimum <b>V</b>iable <b>P</b>roduct.
      
      <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;<i>Viability</i>, really, was my primary concern in the MVP. I was tasked with developing this in Qualtrics, after all, thus leaving me with a seemingly impossible goal:
      <br><div style="font-size:3.5vmin; text-align:center;"><b>How in the world could I engage kids with an online survey?</b></div>
      
      <br>&emsp;&emsp;Indeed, given the focus on emotional development, the project would not be <i>viable</i> at all if the students taking it were not fully invested in the experience. Though this can partially be remedied through skillful writing as well as research on social and emotional learning, design was a core component. Such a restrictive design challenge as this - engaging students <u>only</u> through the placement of words on a page - is always something I love to tackle.

      <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;To start, I recognized that reading (and by extension, taking a survey) is consciously viewed as requiring <i>effort</i> by students; especially those who do not enjoy literature on their own. Thus, my goal became to minimize as much as possible the <u>conscious work</u> that goes into reading, while maximizing the <b>latent curiosity</b> people experience from novel tasks. In the words on Don Norman, creating work that does not feel like work.

      <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Here is an example before I go any further. Both images below represent the <u>exact same</u> text: a brief description and some dialogue. The one on the left uses traditional literary standards, whereas the one on the right applies some of the principles I created for this project.<br>

        <img class = "sampleImage" style="width:45vw; height:13.85vw; vertical-align:text-top" src="media/VIBESExample1.PNG"/>
        <img class = "sampleImage" style="width:45vw; height:51vw; vertical-align:text-top" src="media/VIBESExample2.PNG"/>

      <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Looking at these samples with but a cursory glance, the <u>left</u> image appears as writing typically does. It is thus easily dismissed or skimmed over by disinterested students. The <u>right</u> image, on the other hand, requires a more careful degree of consideration, and is not immediately classified in one's mind as typical prose. It is not to the point of being unreadable, of course, but it encourages <i>curiosity</i>, and brings out the inherent human need for <b>pattern recognition</b>. On the left is a pattern kids have seen a million times; one they may have a distaste for. On the right is something new to discover and explore.

      <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;I cannot emphasize enough the value of this first impression. <i>Reminiscing</i> can last a lifetime, but there is only <b>one</b> opportunity to capture that engagement in the first place.

      <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Next, let us begin actually reading the text. The description of rain going from light to strong is made <b>physical</b> in the right image: the words themselves becoming denser and swifter just as the raindrops do. Such spacing also serves the dual purpose of controlling the <u>pace</u> of reading, just as one would rush more in a downpour than a light drizzle.

      <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;As for the dialogue, giving each of the two characters a different alignment provides an unspoken indication of their <u>locations</u> relative to you in the story. It also makes it much easier for readers to understand <i>who</i> is speaking in longer exchanges. As for the content of the dialogue, using even simple text effects can add a great deal of personality and <b>presence</b>. Jane's use of bold indicates the emphasis in her words, and the description of her movement physically moves up with her. Meanwhile, having Jack's dialogue become slightly smaller as he goes on provides a physical indicator of him trailing off.

      <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;This careful placement and tweaking of simple words on a page comes with the added benefit of providing those who do not learn well from reading or listening to words - so-called <u>visual or tactile learners</u> - with an additional foothold in the experience, enhancing their understanding of the scenario thanks to greater visual and physical engagement.

      <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Extending all such principles over the entire course of the product thus keeps students engaged: wondering what other novel ideas will be presented to them and making the actual <i>content</i> of the words that much more likely to have an impact and be <b>remembered</b> long after the experience has completed.

      <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Returning for a moment to the work of Don Norman, the chart below demonstrates how this design engages all three <b>levels of processing</b>, from one's initial reaction, to their experience of the work, to later refection on its impact.

      <img class = "sampleImage" style = "height: 20vw; display: block; margin: auto;" src="media/VIBESProcessing.PNG"/>

      Now, <b>what does all this amount to?</b>
      <br>&emsp;&emsp;-The text provides a <u>strong first impression</u> by engaging one's curiosity.
      <br>&emsp;&emsp;-It provides far greater <u>pacing</u> and physical <u>presence</u>, making the visual design alone feel <u>interactive</u>.
      <br>&emsp;&emsp;-It is more <u>accessible and effective</u> for those who are <u>visual or tactile learners</u>.
      <br>&emsp;&emsp;-It keeps kids' <u>interest</u> as to what unexpected surprises could come next.
      <br>&emsp;&emsp;-And there is ultimately a much <u>greater, lasting impact</u> from the experience.

      <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Inspiration and influences for this and other aspects of my work came from sources in both design and literature. Undoubtedly, Don Norman's work on <i>emotional design</i> and <i>levels of processing</i> provided invaluable lenses through which to consider and approach this task. As far as literature goes, stories written in verse such as <i>Long Way Down</i> by Jason Reynolds, and interactive narratives such as <i>Kentucky Route Zero</i> by Cardboard Computer provided great examples of how to experiment with literary design and engagement.

      <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Though large-scale testing has yet to begin as of this writing, my work - which includes far more than is detailed here - has been put into practice and I have received excellent feedback on it from the experts in design, software development, and education who have led the VIBES project. Given time, I know its positive impact will be felt by many, thanks to the dedication brought to this challenge.

    <div class = "optionText dreamsText" style="text-align:left; line-height:2">
      <br>&emsp;&emsp;When considering the senior project for my Human-Computer Interaction degree, I decided to create a proof-of-concept piece of software for the blind, ultimately settling on a video game: a challenging, restrictive decision given the visual nature of the medium. Though the project's full documentation can be found <a href="media/Dying%20Dreams%20Paper.pdf" target="_blank" style="color:rgb(235, 130, 55)">here</a>, I describe below one of the major issues I contended with when developing the project: conveying needed information to the user concisely.

      <br><br><b>The Challenges of Auditory Information Sharing</b>

      <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Below is perhaps the most basic user flow one can make, showing (in broad strokes) how people interact with information a product gives them.

        <img class = "sampleImage" alt = "A basic user flow depicting a user seeing information, deciding what do, and then performing their desired action." style = "height:20vw; display: block; margin: auto;" src="media/DDFlow1.PNG"/>

      &emsp;&emsp;Critically, most software expects users to <i>visually</i> process information - often a great deal of information - before deciding their next action. Such data even includes subtle visual cues we are not always consciously aware of. Take, for example, the wireframed scene below, which could be a typical moment in any game.

        <img class = "sampleImage" alt = "A wireframed image of a video game, with several allies and enemies fighting." style = "height: 20vw; display: block; margin: auto;" src="media/DDFlow2.PNG"/>

      &emsp;&emsp;Even a cursory glance at this scenario provides a <i>sighted</i> user with a wide variety of information: who enemies and allies are based on color, all characters' positions, characters' names, each character's vitality - and all of this before even introducing the player's options. Yet what is trivial for a sighted user is of no use to a blind one, and I was thus tasked with presenting all this information in a similarly concise way through audio alone.

      <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;The main realization I came to is that, in the same way visual information need not be tediously listed, neither does auditory information. Certain audio cues could be used to allow multiple pieces of information to be presented simultaneously:

        <img class = "sampleImage" alt = "A chart demonstrating that a character's location can be represented via 3D audio, their vitality through a statement, and which character is currently being discussed by using different voices." style = "height: 20vw; display: block; margin: auto;" src="media/DDFlow3.PNG"/>

      &emsp;&emsp;Bringing all of the information in the above chart together: if you hear a <i>voice you recognize</i> as your ally's, to your <i>left</i>, saying that they are <i>slightly hurt</i>, you would have all the same information about this character that would have been given to you visually, provided all at once. Repeat this same process for every other character present, and you have all of the information you need.

      <br> <br>&emsp;&emsp;Thus, by using a <i>turn-based</i> method of decision making, I could concisely provide all needed information via audio, and let the user take their time to decide their next move. As such, this program's basic user flow looks pretty different, looping through the necessary information until the user decides their next move, and then starting over again:

        <img class = "sampleImage" alt = "A new user flow representing this program, which shows how necessary information loops until the player makes their decision." style = "height: 20vw; display: block; margin: auto;" src="media/DDFlow4.PNG"/>

      &emsp;&emsp;This was but one of several challenges I faced in creating audio-based software, all of which I thoroughly enjoyed. It is vital that design language and accessibility standards for the blind are further developed, and it was an honor to contribute to that body of work.

      Donator: Tech for Those Who Cannot Pay
    </div>

    <div class = "optionText donatorText" style = "text-align:left; line-height:2">
      <br>&emsp;&emsp;For a university user experience design course, myself and a small team were tasked with designing, wireframing, and prototyping an application for an external client from the Royal Bank of Canada. Our client requested that this application allow for cashless donations to the homeless, in addition to other charitable causes.

      <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Tackling this issue required serious considerations of how the homeless population would be able to use any created software without constant access to requisite hardware. To begin, we performed preliminary research on existing applications for cashless transfer of funds and charitable donations. The ensuing brainstorming sessions resulted in the following <b>affinity diagram</b>, including opportunities, breakdowns, and other considerations.

      <img class = "sampleImage" style = "height: 20vw; display: block; margin: auto;" src="media/DonatorBrainstorming.PNG"/>

      &emsp;&emsp;Following this, we performed user research, including <b>interviews</b> I led with professionals in the field of charitable contributions. From that, we developed three <b>personas</b> of typical users of the app, including a homeless person, and a user hoping to donate, someone looking to raise funds for charitable purposes.

      <img class = "sampleImage" style = "width: 90vw; height: auto; display: block; margin: auto;" src="media/DonatorPersonas.PNG"/>

      &emsp;&emsp;With our background knowledge complete, are our target audiences identified, we moved onto ideating how exactly to solve our main issue: ensuring that the homeless could benefit from software they could seldom access. With encouragement from our client, we soon settled on using <b>QR codes</b> as a method of facilitating access. Such codes could be printed by homeless users at libraries or shelters with internet access, and then easily scanned by passers-by wanting to contribute.

      <img class = "sampleImage" style = "height: 20vw; display: block; margin: auto;" src="media/DonatorPrototype/assets/Print%20Card.png"/>

      &emsp;&emsp;Our main interaction now decided upon, we went about defining the primary scenarios of how and why people would use Donator, creating the four <b>storyboards</b> below to map out the features we would need for our prototype.

      <img class = "sampleImage" style = "height: 20vw; display: block; margin: auto;" src="media/DonatorStoryboards.PNG"/>

      &emsp;&emsp;Finally, we began work on <b>wireframing</b> our project, laying out its interactive and visual design. After several sprints and consulting with our client for feedback, we had created a functional <b>prototype</b> using <b>Invision</b>. Though it takes a minute or two to load, the full prototype we delivered can be found <a href = "media/DonatorPrototype/index.html" target="_blank" style="color:rgb(235, 130, 55")>here</a>. Below is a sample <b>user flow</b> demonstrating a piece of functionality I personally implemented for donating to a homeless individual.

      <img class = "sampleImage" style = "height: 20vw; display: block; margin: auto;" src="media/DonatorFlow.PNG"/>

      &emsp;&emsp;Ultimately, we received positive feedback from our client at RBC, who thanked us for providing novel solutions to issues they faced in cashless payments and serving their less financially privileged clients. Personally, I was thankful to have worked on a project with such competent teammates, one which challenged and grew my design sensibilities, and which allowed me to delve into my passion for inclusive and accessible technology.

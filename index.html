My name is Nicola Frachesen and I'm a designer, writer, and programmer with a focus on user experience, accessibility, and communication. Thus, I hope to make technology and other services impactful and inviting to those who need it most. I'm currently performing contract work on the VIBES project for Deep Designs, LLC, which supports children's social and emotional learning.<br><br>On a more personal note, I enjoy reading, hiking, video games, unusual foods, and being intensely curious about pretty much everything.</div>
